== Introduction
The `JdbmCacheStore` is a cache loader implementation based on the
link:$$http://jdbm.sourceforge.net/$$[JDBM] engine, a fast and free alternative to BerkeleyDB.

== Javadoc
For detailed description of all the parameters supported by this store,
please consult the link:$$http://docs.jboss.org/infinispan/4.0/apidocs/$$[javadoc].

== Configuration
This cache store utilizes the file system to store data.
It requires a `location` attribute, which maps to a directory to be used as a persistent store.
(e.g., `location="/tmp/myDataStore"`).
